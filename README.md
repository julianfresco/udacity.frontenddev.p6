# Feed Reader Testing Suite Project (P6)

In this project, I wrote spec tests for an RSS feed application. This testing
suite uses the [Jasmine version 2.1 testing framework](http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html) for JavaScript.

### How to view tests

You can view the tests two ways: manually, or via github pages.

1. **Manually**:
To view the tests manually, download a copy of this repository either using 
the git clone command `git clone https://github.com/julianfresco/udacity.frontenddev.p6.git` or by clicking Download Zip from my [project github page](https://github.com/julianfresco/udacity.frontenddev.p6). After downloading, open the `index.html` from the project root directory.
2. **Github Pages**: Simply take advantage of Github pages hosting to save some extra steps. Navigate to [http://julianfresco.github.io/udacity.frontenddev.p6](http://julianfresco.github.io/udacity.frontenddev.p6) to view the same `index.html` file mentioned in the manual instruction. 

The Jasmine tests will run *automatically* when this page loads, and the results will appear in a frame at the bottom of the page, under the Jasmine logo. The header of the results section will have a title: *{X} specs, {Y} failures*.
